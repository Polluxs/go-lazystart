# go-lazystart

This is my 'Ghost in the Shell' starter template, inspired by the idea of copying from other projects to save time. I strive to create the most concise and versatile starting point possible for any new endeavor.

-- Just remember: **it's not copy-paste if it's copy-clone**

For the ones that forgot:

````bash
git clone git@github.com:Polluxs/go-lazystart.git foldername
`````

Also don't forget:
```bash
sudo rm -r .git
```

### Build commands

Build binary `hello` for linux:

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ./dist/`hello`
```
````
